# Integration External API Cars

This project demonstrates integration with an external Cars API. It fetches car data from an external source and processes or displays it using Java. The goal is to show how to call external REST APIs, map responses, and incorporate them into your application logic.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `Cars/` — Contains the Java source code (classes) that manage fetching and handling external car information.  
- `.idea/` — IDE configuration files (optional / for your environment).

---

## 🚀 Features
- Send HTTP requests to external Cars API endpoints  
- Map JSON responses to Java objects/entities  
- Process or display car data (e.g. list of cars, details)  
- Error handling for API failures / invalid responses

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies
- Java  
- HTTP client library (e.g., `HttpURLConnection`, `HttpClient`, or any third-party like `RestTemplate` / `OkHttp` etc.)  
- JSON parsing library (Jackson, GSON, or equivalent)  
- Maven / Build tool (if setup)

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saikrishnavelthapu543/Integration-External-API-Cars.git
Configure the external API endpoint and any API keys (if required) in the code or configuration files.
Build the project (if using a build tool like Maven):
mvn clean install
Run the main class / method that calls the external API and processes the response.

🔍 Usage Examples
List all cars fetched from external API
Get details of a specific car (by id or type)
Handle errors when API is down / JSON is malformed
